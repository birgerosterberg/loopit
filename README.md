[LoopIt Live page link](https://loopit-561b13093461.herokuapp.com/)

Loopit is an online community designed for enthusiasts of a special unique art of music creation, where looping machines like the famous BOSS RC505 are often used. This Django-based web application provides a platform for musicians to collaborate, share tips and tutorials, and discuss their love for this unique art form.

## Agile Planning and Development Process

The development of Loopit followed an Agile methodology, utilizing a Kanban board hosted on GitHub to manage tasks and workflows. This approach made it easier to focus on immediate tasks while also keeping an eye on the broader project goals and progress.

### Kanban Board

[Link to the board](https://github.com/users/birgerosterberg/projects/1/views/1)

The board was divided into three primary columns:

- **Todo**: Tasks that are planned but not yet in progress.
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Done**: Tasks that have been completed.

Each task was created as an issue and then categorized into Epics and User Stories for better organization and focus.

### Epics and User Stories

Prior to starting development, Epics and User Stories were created to define the scope and goals of the project. This made it easier to break down the project into smaller, manageable chunks and helped in tracking progress effectively.

- **Epics**: Large areas of work that contain multiple tasks.
- **User Stories**: Smaller tasks that contribute to the completion of an Epic.

This Agile planning setup contributed significantly to the efficient and focused development of Loopit.

- **Logout**: Sign out of your Loopit account.
- **My Profile**: View and edit your personal profile.
- **Admin**: Access the admin panel to manage users, posts, and more.

Each set of options is deliberately minimal and self-explanatory with extra visuals by using icons, sticking with the overall design philosophy of Loopitâ€”simple, functional, and user-centric.

---

## Categories

Categories are a key feature of Loopit, designed to help users easily navigate and discover content that interests them.

### How it Works

![Categories](readme_files/categories.png)

When you land on the main page, the default setting displays posts from all categories. The categories are listed in their own navigation bar, and each serves as a filter:

- **All**: Shows posts from all categories. This is the default view when the page loads.
- **General**: Shows posts only from 'General'.
- **Hardware**: Shows posts only from 'Hardware'.
- **Software**: Shows posts only from 'Software'.
- ... (and so on for other categories)

### Active Category Highlight

When you click on a category, the background color of that category changes to gray to indicate that it is the active filter. This visual cue helps you instantly recognize what content you're currently viewing.

### User Experience

The category system streamlines user experience by allowing quick and effortless content filtering. Just click a category, and the page will automatically update to show posts that match your selection.

The goal is to help you find what you're looking for with minimal effort, aligning with Loopit's overarching design philosophy of simplicity and functionality.

---

## Create Post

For logged-in users, the "Create Post" button is a crucial part of the Loopit experience and serves as the primary call-to-action on the platform.

### Design and Placement

![Create post Button](readme_files/createp.png)

Designed with an elegant aesthetic, this button stands out without being overwhelming. Its design cues make it clear that creating a post is an important action on this platform. The button is strategically placed for maximum visibility and easy access, encouraging users to share their content.

### Availability

The "Create Post" button is only available to users who are logged in, emphasizing its role as a feature for community members.

### User Experience

Clicking the button takes you to a simple and intuitive form that makes post creation a breeze. This is aligned with Loopit's core design philosophy of making user interactions as seamless as possible.

![create new post form page](readme_files/createnewp.png)

### Post Creation Experience

Creating a post on Loopit is designed to be a fluid and enriching experience, thanks to the feature-rich SummerNote widget for the content section and the essential category selection. Here's what you can expect:

#### Title

The first field you'll encounter is the title. A compelling title can capture the essence of your post and attract more viewers.

#### Content

For the content, I've integrated the powerful SummerNote widget. It provides an array of options, from simple text formatting to adding images, links, and even code snippets. This allows you to customize your post exactly the way you want it, enhancing both the creation and consumption experience.

#### Categories

Before publishing, you'll need to select a category for your post. This helps in placing your post within the relevant topic, making it easier for community members to find and engage with your content.

#### Create Post Button

Finally, there's the 'Create' button. A simple click, and your post goes live, sharing your content with the Loopit community.

This intuitive and straightforward process reflects Loopit's commitment to creating an environment where anyone can easily contribute and share their expertise or interests.

## Post Display

The Post display on Loopit is designed to give you all the essential information you need at a glance, while keeping the layout simple and uncluttered.

### Layout and Information

![Presenting a post view](readme_files/postv.png)

#### Title

The first thing you'll notice is the title of the post, prominently displayed to capture your attention and give you an idea of what the post is about.

#### Author and Category

Underneath the title on the left-hand side, you'll find the author's name followed by the category the post belongs to. This arrangement helps you quickly gauge the topic and the credibility of the post.

#### Date, Time, and Comments

On the right-hand side of the title, the date and time the post was created are displayed. Just next to it, you'll see an icon accompanied by a number indicating the total number of comments on the post. This provides a snapshot of the level of engagement the post has received.

#### User Experience

By placing everything you need to know in an organized, easy-to-read format, Loopit aims to make content discovery both efficient and pleasant.

#### Hover Effect

To further enhance user interaction, a subtle hover effect has been implemented on each post display. When you hover over a post, the opacity changes to indicate that it's clickable. This visual cue adds to the platform's overall user-friendly design by making navigation more intuitive.

---

## Post View Page

## Individual Post View Page

Once you click on a post from the homepage, you are taken to the individual 'Post View' page, where you can delve deeper into the content and its details.
![read post user view](readme_files/readpost_user.png)

### Layout and Components

#### Title and Information View

At the top, you are greeted with the title of the post, immediately followed by an information section. This section provides details like the Author's name, the Category the post falls under, and the Time and Date when the post was made.

#### Content Container

As you scroll down, you'll find the 'Content Container,' which houses the meat of the post. This could be text, images, and even embedded YouTube videos, providing a rich and engaging experience.

#### Comment Counter

In the bottom corner of the 'Content Container,' there's a comment count display, giving you an idea of the post's engagement level.

### Conditional Features

Depending on who is viewing the post, additional options are made available:

- **General Users**: For visitors without an account, no additional options are shown.
  ![no user view](readme_files/no_user_view.png)

  ![post owner view](readme_files/owner_view.png)

---

## Comment Section

Engaging with posts goes beyond just viewing them. The Comment Section offers users an opportunity to share their thoughts, ask questions, or simply engage with the community.

![comment part](readme_files/comment.png)

### Comment Display

#### Author, Date, and Time

Each comment clearly displays the Author's name, as well as the Date and Time when the comment was posted. This provides context and credibility to each comment.

#### Report Link for Logged-In Users

For logged-in users, a 'Report' link is available next to each comment, allowing for the reporting of inappropriate or offensive content.

#### Comment Content

Following the author and timestamp information, the actual content of the comment is displayed, facilitating meaningful discussions and interactions.

### Commenting Interface

The interface for posting a comment is designed to be as straightforward as possible:

#### Account Display

Before you type, the username you are logged into is displayed, so you can ensure you're commenting from the correct account, especially if you manage multiple profiles such as an artist account and a private user account.

#### Text Field and Submit Button

To comment, all you need to do is type your thoughts into a generously sized text field and hit the 'Submit' button. It's that simple.

By keeping the comment section user-friendly and intuitive, Loopit continues to foster a community where everyone feels comfortable to express themselves.

---

## User Profiles

Loopit offers personalized user profiles to enhance community engagement and provide a space for individual expression.

### Accessing Profiles

You can navigate to a user's profile in several ways:

- **Author Names**: Clicking on the author names in post or comment sections will direct you to that user's profile.
- **My Profile Link**: Logged-in users can easily access their own profile by clicking the 'My Profile' link in the navigation bar.

### Profile Components

#### Public Profile

When you land on a user's profile, you'll find the following:

- **Profile Picture**: A profile image of the user, which adds a personal touch.
- **First and Last Name**: User's identified name to know who you are interacting with.
- **About**: A section where users can write a little something about themselves, further fostering a sense of community.

![profile visit](readme_files/profilev.png)

#### Personal Profile

When viewing your own profile, additional options are available:

- **Edit Profile Button**: This button takes you to a form where you can:
  - Add or change your profile picture.
  - Modify your first and last name.
  - Update or add text to your 'About' section.

![edit profile page](readme_files/editprofile.png)

By providing these features, Loopit aims to create a platform where users can feel recognized and engaged, amplifying the sense of community.

---

## Pagination

Loopit offers a simple yet effective pagination system to help users navigate through the growing library of posts efficiently.

### How It Works

- **Next Button**: Once there are more than 10 posts displayed on the front page, a 'Next' button will appear at the bottom of the post list. Clicking this will take you to the next set of posts.

![next page](readme_files/nextp.png)!

- **Previous Button**: When you're on subsequent pages, a 'Previous' button will also appear beside the 'Next' button. Clicking 'Previous' takes you back to the prior set of posts.

![previous page](readme_files/prevp.png)

This intuitive pagination setup ensures that users can easily explore more content without feeling overwhelmed by a seemingly endless scroll of posts.

## Technical Features

### Responsive Design

Loopit was built with a responsive design to ensure an optimal user experience across a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### CRUD on Posts

The platform allows for full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user-generated posts. This enables users to freely share their insights, ask questions, and interact with the community.

### Simple Easy Design

Ease of use was a primary consideration during the design phase. Loopit features a clean, intuitive interface that lets users navigate the site with minimal effort.

## Database Design

The database consists of several tables, each representing a different aspect of the Loopit platform. Below is a schema overview:

### Tables

1. **User** (Inherited from Django's built-in User model)

   - id (Auto-generated)
   - username
   - password
   - email
   - ...

2. **Report**

   - id (Auto-generated)
   - reporter (Foreign Key -> User)
   - content_type (Foreign Key -> ContentType)
   - object_id (PositiveIntegerField)
   - reported_item (GenericForeignKey)
   - reason (CharField, max_length=200)
   - timestamp (DateTimeField, auto_now_add=True)

3. **Category**

   - id (Auto-generated)
   - name (CharField, max_length=100)
   - description (TextField)

4. **Post**

   - id (Auto-generated)
   - title (CharField, max_length=200)
   - slug (AutoSlugField, unique=True)
   - author (Foreign Key -> User)
   - category (Foreign Key -> Category)
   - content (TextField)
   - image (CloudinaryField)
   - created_on (DateTimeField, auto_now_add=True)
   - reports (GenericRelation -> Report)

5. **Comment**

   - id (Auto-generated)
   - post (Foreign Key -> Post)
   - author (Foreign Key -> User)
   - body (TextField)
   - created_on (DateTimeField, auto_now_add=True)
   - upvibes (ManyToManyField -> User)
   - reports (GenericRelation -> Report)

6. **UserProfile**

   - id (Auto-generated)
   - user (OneToOneField -> User)
   - profile_picture (CloudinaryField, blank=True)
   - first_name (CharField, max_length=100, blank=True)
   - last_name (CharField, max_length=100, blank=True)
   - about (TextField, blank=True)

### Relationships

- A `User` can have multiple `Posts` but each `Post` belongs to one `User`.
- A `Post` can belong to one `Category`.
- A `User` can have multiple `Reports` but each `Report` is created by one `User`.
- A `User` can have multiple `Comments` but each `Comment` is created by one `User`.
- A `User` has one `UserProfile`.
- A `Post` can have multiple `Comments` but each `Comment` belongs to one `Post`.

## Design Philosophy

As the sole developer behind Loopit, my design philosophy centers around minimalism and a user-focused approach. I wanted to create a space where users feel at ease and can focus on what matters mostâ€”loop-based music.

### Color Scheme

I chose a dark background (`bg-dark`) coupled with light text (`text-light`) to achieve a high-contrast, visually appealing design that is also easy on the eyes.

### Framework

I opted for Bootstrap as my go-to framework. It simplified the development process, letting me concentrate more on features and less on layout issues. Plus, Bootstrap comes with a plethora of built-in components that are both functional and aesthetic.

### Minimalistic Approach

Minimalism was always at the forefront of my mind while designing this platform. My goal was to include only what's absolutely necessary for users, eliminating any elements that could distract or confuse. This 'less is more' philosophy has shaped Loopit into a platform that's simple but efficient, devoid of any unnecessary bells and whistles.
